### Some combinatorics code
I like counting things. But more to the point...
* The `novelli_pak_stoyanovskii.py` file contains code to compute the Novelli-Pak-Stoyanovskii algorithm for the
    proof of the hook-length formula. It is outlined in the paper by Jean-Christophe Novelli, Igor Pak,
    and Alexander Stoyanovskii, [A direct bijective proof of the hook-length
    formula](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/bij.pdf).
* The `franzblau_zeilberger.py` file contains code to compute the Franzblau-Zeilberger bijection between
    permutations and standard Young tableaux. It is outlined in the paper by Debbie Franzblau and Doron Zeilberger,
    [A bijective proof of the hook-length formula](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0196677482900293).
* The `lenstra_lenstra_lovasz.py` file contains code to compute the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov치sz algorithm for the
    proof of the hook-length formula. It is outlined in the paper by Arjen K. Lenstra, Hendrik W. Lenstra Jr.,
    and L치szl칩 Lov치sz,
    [Factoring polynomials with rational coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm).
