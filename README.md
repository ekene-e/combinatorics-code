### Some combinatorics code
I like counting things. Sometimes, counting is easy and I can do it with my fingers. Other times, counting is
not as trivial and I need a pen and paper and permutations and combinations to count things. Sometimes, counting
doesn't seem as trivial as we typically think it to be, and I need to write code to count well. This repository
contains some of the code I have written to count things over the years. I hope you find it useful. Or at least
interesting. Or at least not boring. Or at least not too boring. Or at least not too boring to the point that you
fall asleep. Or at least not too boring to the point that you fall asleep and start snoring. But interesting 
enough that you count and count and count and fall asleep and start snoring and dream about counting, and wake
up and prove some counting things. More to the point...
* The `novelli_pak_stoyanovskii.py` file contains code to compute the Novelli-Pak-Stoyanovskii algorithm for the
    proof of the hook-length formula. It is outlined in the paper by Jean-Christophe Novelli, Igor Pak,
    and Alexander Stoyanovskii, [A direct bijective proof of the hook-length
    formula](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/bij.pdf).
* The `franzblau_zeilberger.py` file contains code to compute the Franzblau-Zeilberger bijection between
    permutations and standard Young tableaux. It is outlined in the paper by Debbie Franzblau and Doron Zeilberger,
    [A bijective proof of the hook-length formula](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0196677482900293).
* The `lenstra_lenstra_lovasz.py` file contains code to compute the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov치sz algorithm for the
